Project: Narcissistic Number

Requirementsï¼š
(1) A narcissus number is an N-digit positive integer (N>=3) whose sum of the Nth powers of each digit is equal to itself. For example, 153= 13 + 53 + 33. The problem is to write a program that allows users to input a digit N randomly through the keyboard and then output all the N-digit narcissus numbers.
(2) Input format: please let the user give a positive integer N (3<=N<=7) in a line through the keyboard.
(3) Output format: output all N-digit narcissus numbers in ascending order, with each number occupying one line.

For example:
Input:
3
Output:
153
370
371
407
